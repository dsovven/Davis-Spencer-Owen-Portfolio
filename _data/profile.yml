intro: >
  Solutions-driven Manufacturing Project Engineer with a track record leading first-time builds
  for critical submarine assemblies. I combine hands-on manufacturing execution with project
  technical leadership across proposal, design, procurement, machining, assembly, NDT, and
  validation. My focus is building robust processes that improve throughput, reduce
  nonconformances, and meet strict customer requirements.

summary: >
  Distinctive blend of technical capability, cross-functional leadership, and practical factory
  experience. At General Atomics, I was promoted from Engineer I to Engineer II while scaling
  responsibility from a $3M program to an $18M program. I develop process strategies, detailed
  work instructions, and fixture solutions that support high-reliability manufacturing under
  exacting standards.

focus_areas:
  - "Technical project management in high-reliability manufacturing"
  - "Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFM/DFA)"
  - "Precision machining: EDM, VTL, and 5-axis workflows"
  - "Root cause and corrective action"
  - "Process development, work instructions, and build strategy"
  - "Supply chain coordination and bill of materials development"
  - "Tooling and fixture design for tolerance control"
  - "Nondestructive testing integration and validation readiness"

impact_metrics:
  - "Promoted from Engineer I (led $3M scope) to Engineer II (led $18M scope)."
  - "Developed and continuously improved process plans for 1,000+ component assemblies."
  - "Delivered multi-year first-time builds from proposal through functional validation."
  - "Won new business by authoring and presenting competitive technical proposals."
