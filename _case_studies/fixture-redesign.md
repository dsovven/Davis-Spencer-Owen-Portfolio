## Problem
Briefly describe the failure mode (scrap/rework, tool chatter, datum shift, throughput constraint).

## Constraints
Material, tolerances, inspection method, machine limits, safety, schedule.

## What I did
- Design changes (locating scheme, clamping, support points)
- Process controls (torque specs, setup sheets, poke-yoke)
- Validation (FAI, GR&R, capability study)

## Results (quantify)
- Scrap ↓ X%
- Cycle time ↓ X%
- Throughput ↑ X%
- Cp/Cpk: X → Y
