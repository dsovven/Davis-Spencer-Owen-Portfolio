## Challenge

Program scope required first-time build success for critical submarine assemblies under strict customer and compliance requirements.

## Constraints

- Exacting NAVSEA and Electric Boat requirements.
- Complex supply chain and long-lead fabrication paths.
- Tight coupling between design maturity and production readiness.

## What Was Executed

- Led cross-functional coordination across proposal, design, procurement, machining, assembly, NDT, and functional validation.
- Defined technical manufacturing approach to balance schedule, quality, and process capability.
- Drove issue resolution with root-cause and corrective action methods.

## Outcomes

- Delivered first-time builds across a multi-year execution window.
- Supported transition from Engineer I ownership on a $3M scope to Engineer II ownership on an $18M scope.
- Helped sustain compliant production flow for mission-critical hardware.
