## Challenge

A thin-wall aluminum part was failing final inspection due to chatter marks and dimensional drift during a finishing operation. Scrap and rework were increasing during peak demand.

## Constraints

- Existing machine platform had to stay in place.
- Tooling budget was capped for the quarter.
- Changes needed validation without stopping daily shipments.

## What Was Implemented

- Added compliant support points to reduce wall deflection during clamp-up.
- Reordered clamping sequence and documented torque values in setup instructions.
- Introduced a first-piece verification checklist with go/no-go criteria.

## Results

- Scrap rate dropped from 11.8% to 3.9%.
- Rework hours reduced by 37%.
- Cpk on the key bore dimension improved from 0.88 to 1.42.
