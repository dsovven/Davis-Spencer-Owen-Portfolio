## Project Overview

This personal build demonstrates practical mechanical design thinking, fabrication discipline, and test-driven iteration on a small, low-risk platform.

## Goals

- Build a safe, tabletop-scale trebuchet from plywood and hardwood.
- Apply basic statics and energy-transfer concepts in a real build.
- Document design changes and test results in an engineering format.

## Design and Fabrication

- Modeled side frames, axle supports, and throwing arm geometry.
- Cut and assembled structural parts with repeatable alignment references.
- Added adjustable sling length and release pin angle for tuning.
- Used removable counterweight loading for controlled trials.

## Test and Iteration

- Ran repeated launches at fixed projectile and counterweight conditions.
- Tracked launch distance and consistency across pin-angle changes.
- Increased stiffness with diagonal bracing and base reinforcement.
- Adjusted sling knot position to improve release timing.

## Results

- Achieved stable launches with repeatable range in controlled tests.
- Improved average distance by 28% after structural and release tuning.
- Demonstrated a clear design-test-refine cycle suitable for portfolio review.
