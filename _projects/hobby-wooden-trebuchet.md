## Project Overview

This example project shows how to present a personal build in a professional portfolio. The goal was to design and fabricate a small wooden trebuchet with repeatable launch performance using simple shop tools.

## Goals

- Build a safe, tabletop-scale trebuchet from plywood and hardwood.
- Apply basic statics and energy-transfer concepts in a real build.
- Document design changes and test results in a clear engineering format.

## Design and Fabrication

- Modeled the side frames, axle supports, and throwing arm layout.
- Cut parts from 1/2 in plywood and assembled with wood glue and screws.
- Added adjustable sling length and release pin angle for tuning.
- Used a removable counterweight bucket to quickly vary launch energy.

## Test and Iteration

- Ran repeated launches at fixed counterweight and projectile mass.
- Tracked launch distance and consistency across release pin settings.
- Reduced frame flex by adding diagonal braces and wider base support.
- Updated sling knot position to improve release timing.

## Demo Video

## Results

- Achieved stable launches with repeatable range in a controlled setup.
- Improved average distance by 28% after frame and sling adjustments.
- Demonstrated a clear design-test-refine loop suitable for portfolio review.
