## Challenge

Research objective required an integrated sensing/stimulation PCB platform for Type II Diabetes work, combining hardware design and procurement constraints.

## Constraints

- Academic lab budget and lead-time limitations.
- Iterative prototype needs with evolving technical requirements.

## What Was Implemented

- Led concept research and technical option evaluation.
- Supported PCB design decisions and component selection.
- Managed procurement planning to keep prototype iteration moving.

## Outcomes

- Delivered a working development path for device prototyping.
- Established a structured design-procurement workflow for lab execution.

## Notes

Add approved experimental results or bench-test data if available.
