## Challenge

High component count and variable build conditions increased risk of defects, missed steps, and inconsistent assembly outcomes.

## Constraints

- Large BOM and frequent engineering updates.
- High traceability expectations.
- Need for practical instructions usable by production teams.

## What Was Implemented

- Developed production strategies and build sequences for 1,000+ component assemblies.
- Authored and maintained detailed work instructions with revision discipline.
- Integrated mistake-proofing and quality checkpoints to reduce nonconformance risk.

## Outcomes

- Improved process clarity and repeatability across teams.
- Enabled faster onboarding and smoother execution of complex builds.
- Reduced avoidable defects through proactive process controls.
