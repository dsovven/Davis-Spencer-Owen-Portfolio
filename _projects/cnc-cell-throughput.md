## Challenge

A 3-machine cell was missing weekly delivery targets. The bottleneck operation had long setup events, uneven tool life, and inconsistent shift handoffs.

## Constraints

- No additional headcount approved.
- Customer schedule required stable output during implementation.
- Tooling catalog could only be changed through approved vendors.

## What Was Implemented

- Built a setup reduction plan with pre-staged kits and standardized offsets.
- Switched to a controlled tool-life policy tied to spindle time and part count.
- Added visual handoff boards for in-process work and shift exceptions.

## Results

- Daily output increased from 142 to 176 units.
- Average setup time per changeover dropped from 48 to 29 minutes.
- OEE improved from 63% to 74% within one quarter.
