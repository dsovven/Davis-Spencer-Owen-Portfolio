- Need to align design intent with practical shop-floor execution.

## What Was Implemented

- Produced NX CAD models and supporting drawings.
- Created manufacturing instructions to improve build clarity.
- Coordinated with engineering and production stakeholders for documentation completeness.

## Outcomes

- Supported faster handoff from design to fabrication.
- Improved manufacturability communication in project documentation.
