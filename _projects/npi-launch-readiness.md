## Challenge

A new electromechanical assembly was scheduled for launch with aggressive timing. Early pilot runs showed variable torque performance and inconsistent traceability capture.

## Constraints

- Pilot line had limited process history.
- Test fixtures were still evolving.
- Launch date was locked by customer commitments.

## What Was Implemented

- Facilitated PFMEA sessions and converted high-risk items into control plan checks.
- Defined process qualification plan with IQ/OQ/PQ gates.
- Partnered with quality to finalize reaction plans and defect escalation workflow.

## Results

- Completed launch on schedule with no customer line-stops in first 90 days.
- First-pass yield at SOP reached 95.4% and improved to 97.8% by month three.
- Containment incidents dropped by 60% after closed-loop corrective actions.
